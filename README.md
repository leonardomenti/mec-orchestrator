# Bachelor's Thesis: ETSI MEC Orchestrator in OMNeT++

## Introduction

In the digital age, seamless device-to-device communication is vital. The Internet of Things (IoT) has expanded this connectivity to a range of objects, from autonomous vehicles to smart appliances. However, ensuring fast and stable communication, especially for mobile users, remains a challenge.

Edge Computing has emerged as a solution, offering lower latency and reduced network traffic. The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) has defined the Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) network architecture.

This thesis focuses on recreating the ETSI MEC infrastructure within the OMNeT++ simulation environment, with a particular emphasis on the MEC orchestrator component, which has a global view of the infrastructure.

## Methodology

The study begins with an exploration of the ETSI MEC framework, delving into its components, characteristics, and roles within the architecture. Subsequently, the OMNeT++ simulation environment is introduced, providing documentation on the functionalities used during project design and simulation. The INET framework, an open-source library for the OMNeT++ simulator, is also discussed, highlighting the essential components for the project's implementation.

## Conclusion

This thesis project seeks to bridge the gap between theoretical MEC architecture and practical implementation within the OMNeT++ simulation environment. It focuses on creating entities that represent the MEC framework, enabling in-depth simulations and analysis.
